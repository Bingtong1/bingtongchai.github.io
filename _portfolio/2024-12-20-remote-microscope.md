This project was completed as part of the Embedded Systems course at The University of Queensland (2024.12-2025.01).

## Project Overview

I designed and implemented a remote control microscope system that enables wireless control and monitoring of microscope functions through a user-friendly interface.

## Key Features

- **Real-Time Operating System**: Implemented using FreeRTOS for multitasking and real-time control
- **Wireless Communication**: Integrated wireless modules for remote control capabilities
- **System Control**: Comprehensive control system for microscope functions
- **Display Interface**: User-friendly display for system status and control
- **Console Interaction**: Command-line interface for advanced control and debugging

## Technical Details

- **Platform**: STM32 Nucleo-F429ZI development board
- **RTOS**: FreeRTOS
- **Communication**: Wireless modules (specified by course requirements)
- **Programming**: C/C++

## Project Components

1. **System Control Module**: Core control logic for microscope operations
2. **Wireless Communication Module**: Handles remote command transmission and reception
3. **Display Module**: User interface for status visualization
4. **Console Module**: Command parsing and execution interface

## Learning Outcomes

- Hands-on experience with FreeRTOS and real-time systems
- Embedded system design and integration
- Wireless communication protocols
- User interface design for embedded systems
