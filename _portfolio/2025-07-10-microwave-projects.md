- **Challenge**: Balancing bandwidth and matching performance

## Project 3: Digital Phase Shifters

- **Objective**: Design PIN diode-based phase shifters at 5 GHz
- **Types**:
  - Microstrip digital phase shifter
  - Loaded-line phase shifter
- **Performance**: 
  - 90° phase shift
  - 22.5° phase shift
- **Technology**: PIN diode switching for digital phase control

## Technical Details

- **Frequency**: 5 GHz
