This project was completed as part of my Bachelor's degree at The University of Queensland (2024.07-2025.07).

## Project Overview

I developed a comprehensive model for terahertz quantum cascade lasers (THz QCLs) under external optical injection, focusing on the nonlinear dynamics and various oscillation regimes.

## Key Contributions

- **Rate Equation Modeling**: Established rate equations for externally injected laser systems in MATLAB
- **Parameter Analysis**: Investigated the effects of injection parameters (injection photon number and frequency detuning) on laser output
- **Bifurcation Analysis**: Derived and analyzed Saddle-node and Hopf bifurcation diagrams through mathematical derivation of the laser system rate equations
- **Oscillation Regimes**: Explored different types of oscillations and output variations

## Technical Details

- **Tools**: MATLAB
- **Focus Areas**: Nonlinear dynamics, laser physics, bifurcation theory
- **Application**: Understanding laser stability and dynamics for potential applications in THz spectroscopy and imaging

## Impact

This research contributes to the understanding of injection-locked THz QCLs, which are important for coherent THz sources in applications such as biomedical imaging, security screening, and materials characterization.
