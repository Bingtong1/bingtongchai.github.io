This project was completed during my internship at Porsche Australia (2023.05-2023.06).

## Project Overview

I designed and developed a high-precision programmable switching power supply for industrial applications, focusing on high efficiency, precision control, and robust communication capabilities.

## Key Features

- **High-Efficiency Architecture**: Implemented LLC resonant converter combined with peak current mode Boost for isolated power conversion
- **Dual-Channel Design**: 800W total power output with independent channel control
- **Communication System**: RS-485 bus communication for parameter configuration and remote monitoring
- **EMI Optimization**: Improved electromagnetic interference (EMI) design and PCB layout for enhanced immunity

## Technical Details

- **Power Rating**: 800W total (dual-channel)
- **Control System**: STM32 & C2000 microcontrollers
- **Communication**: RS-485 bus protocol
- **Topology**: LLC resonant + Boost converter
- **Tools**: Altium Designer (PCB design), MATLAB/Simulink (control design)

## Challenges and Solutions

- **EMI Management**: Optimized PCB layout and EMI filter design to meet industrial standards
- **Efficiency Optimization**: Fine-tuned LLC resonant parameters for optimal efficiency across load range
- **System Integration**: Coordinated multiple power modules through RS-485 bus communication

## Impact

This project demonstrates practical application of power electronics principles in industrial settings, with focus on efficiency, reliability, and system integration.
