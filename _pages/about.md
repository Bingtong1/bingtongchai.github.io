# About Me

I am a Master of Engineering Science student at The University of Queensland (UQ), pursuing a degree in Electrical Engineering (2026.2-2026.12). I completed my Bachelor of Engineering (Honours) at UQ (2023.7-2025.7) through the 2+2 program with Jiangsu University, where I also earned my first Bachelor's degree in Electrical Engineering and Automation (2021.9-2023.6).

## Research Interests

My research interests include:
- **Terahertz Quantum Cascade Lasers (THz QCLs)**: Nonlinear dynamics under optical injection, laser dynamics modeling
- **Power Electronics**: High-precision programmable power supplies, LLC resonant converters, power conversion systems
- **Microwave Engineering**: Antenna design, impedance matching, phase shifters, RF circuit design
- **Embedded Systems**: Real-time operating systems (FreeRTOS), microcontroller applications, wireless communication

## Current Research

My current research focuses on **laser dynamics of terahertz quantum cascade lasers under optical injection**. This project involves:
- Developing rate equation models for externally injected laser systems
- Simulating laser output variations under different injection conditions (injection photon number, frequency detuning)
- Analyzing different types of oscillations and bifurcations (Saddle-node and Hopf bifurcations)
- Exploring the nonlinear dynamics of laser systems using MATLAB simulations
