# About Me

I am a (future) Master of Engineering Science student at The University of Queensland (UQ) and a graduate of the 2+2 program between Jiangsu University and UQ. My current research interests include terahertz quantum cascade lasers (THz QCLs), nonlinear dynamics under optical injection, and intelligent energy systems such as AI-powered hot water control.

Previously, I worked on:
- High-precision programmable power supply design (800 W, dual-channel LLC converter with STM32 & C2000 control)
- Smart hot water system "FlowSense" focusing on energy saving and sustainability
- Teaching/learning materials for AI, image processing, and speech recognition labs
